"""
The first line imports the library functions for MQTT.

The callback functions
    on_connect - automatically called by the client upon connection to the broker
    on_message - automatically called upon receiving a message

The on_connect function prints the result of the connection attempt, and performs the subscription.
Note that subscribe happens only after the client is connected to the broker.

The on_message function prints the received message when it comes in, as well as the topic it was published under.

Body of the code:
1. Instantiate a client object with the client ID.
2. Define the callback functions to use upon connection and upon message receipt.
3. Connect to an MQTT broker at i.e. m2m.eclipse.org or a local broker: 102.168.20.1, on port 1883 (the default MQTT port)
   with a keepalive of 60 seconds (this is how often the client pings the broker to keep the connection alive).
4. The last line starts a network daemon that runs in the background and handles data transactions and messages, as well as keeping the socket open, until the script ends.
   In this case it never ends - loop_forever() unless the script is interrupted with a break command.
